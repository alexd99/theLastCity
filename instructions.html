        <p class="storyText">
            The zombie apocalypse happened years ago, but the disease still rages. The virus needs blood to survive, when the virus attaches to a host it               hijacks their brain and makes them into a killing machine. The scary part is that these “zombies” aren't dead. They are still living people                 with the strength, and speed of a human, but the virus damages the brain so that most of the human intelligence is lost.

        <p class="storyText">
            You lost everything when the virus first broke out; your wife and family turned into monsters. You had no choice but to ... “Hey!” some yells                   breaking your train of thought. A stranger is running up to you, “We have a survivalist town up ahead would you care to join us?” You have seen             many of these “towns” throughout your travels, they have never appealed to you, until now. “Sure,“ you say. You and the stranger walk to the                 town. It is nothing like the towns before the first outbreak. It is small with a few tents and four walls made of a weak wood. You bring the population to                twelve. You have military experience and are immediately assigned as second in command. That night a huge hoard swarms the base. You, and the citizens fight with all                   your might, nearly exhausting the ammunition supply the town has, but all your efforts are not enough. The leader of the town charges the hoard with nothing but a                 Katana, a Japanese sword,  killing enough zombies to save the town, but dying in the process. You are now in charge. You have to lead this town to victory.                    The town has some farms for food and a small mine to gather gold to buy goods from the traveling merchants. How long can you help the people in this                     town survive? Can you lead them to victory?

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <p>
            The town must have food to survive, if your food runs out people will start to die. Each Person in you town must have 1 food a day. Farmers make             4 food a day. Assign farmers to make food.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soldiers are necessary to defend your town. Soldiers fight better with ammo, if the ammo runs out the soldiers can still fight, just not as                  effectively. The more soldiers, the more defense the town has, but the more ammo you use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gold is necessary to buy supplies from traveling merchants. Assign miners to dig up gold. Miners dig up 1 to 5 gold a day, but be careful the mines may collapse killing a miner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wood is used in upgrades and as fuel in the forge. assign lumberjacks to cut wood, but be careful because the forests are outside the city wall and lumberjack may die.
