        <p class="storyText">
            The zombie apocalypse happened years ago, but the disease still rages. The virus needs blood to survive, when the virus attaches to a host it               hijacks their brain and makes them into a killing machine. The scary part is that these “zombies” aren't dead. They are still living people                 with the strength, and speed of a human, but the virus damages the brain so that most of the human intelligence is lost.

            You lost everything when the virus first broke out. You wife and family turned into monsters, you had no choice but to, “Hey!” some yells                   breaking your train of thought. A stranger is running up to you. “We have a survivalist town up ahead would you care to join us?” You have seen             many of these “towns” throughout your travels, they have never appealed to you, until now. “Sure you say” You and the stranger, walk to the                 town. It is nothing the the towns before the first outbreak. It is small with a few tents and a couple of walls. You bring the population to                twelve. You have military experience and are immediately assigned as second in command. That night the zombies attack. You fight with all                   you might, nearly exhausting the ammunition supply the town had, but it is not enough. The leader of the town charges into the hoard with a                 katana, killing enough zombies to save the town, but dying in the process. You are now in charge. You have to lead this town to victory.                    The town has some farms for food a small mine to gather gold to buy goods from traveling merchants. How long can you help the people in this                     town survive?

        <p>
            The town must have food to survive if your food runs out people will start to die. Each Person in you town must have 1 food a day. Farmers make             4 food a day. Assign farmers to make food.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soldiers are necessary to defend your town. Soldiers fight better with ammo if the ammo runs out the soldiers can still fight, just not as                  effectively. The more soldiers the more defense the town has, but the more ammo you use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gold is necessary to buy supplies from traveling merchants. Assign miners to dig up gold. Miners dig up 1 to 5 gold a day.
