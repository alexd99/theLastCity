	    <h2>The Story</h2>

        <p class="storyText">
            The zombie apocalypse happened years ago, but the disease still rages. The virus needs blood to survive, when the virus attaches to a host it               hijacks their brain and makes them into a killing machine. The scary part is that these “zombies” aren't dead. They are still living people                 with the strength, and speed of a human, but the virus damages the brain so that most of the human intelligence is lost.
        </p>
        <p class="storyText">
            You lost everything when the virus first broke out; your wife and family turned into monsters. You had no choice but to ... “Hey!” some yells                   breaking your train of thought. A stranger is running up to you, “We have a survivalist town up ahead would you care to join us?” You have seen             many of these “towns” throughout your travels, they have never appealed to you, until now. “Sure,“ you say. You and the stranger walk to the                 town. It is nothing like the towns before the first outbreak. It is small with a few tents and four walls made of a weak wood. You bring the population to                twelve. You have military experience and are immediately assigned as second in command. That night a huge hoard swarms the base. You, and the citizens fight with all                   your might, nearly exhausting the ammunition supply the town has, but all your efforts are not enough. The leader of the town charges the hoard with nothing but a                 Katana, a Japanese sword,  killing enough zombies to save the town, but dying in the process. You are now in charge. You have to lead this town to victory.                    The town has some farms for food and a small mine to gather gold to buy goods from the traveling merchants. How long can you help the people in this                     town survive? Can you lead them to victory?

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>The Basics</h3>
        <p>Your goal is to let your town survive long enough to discover 1 of the 4 possible endings. You can change your citizen's jobs, changing what they gather or defend. Each day you must get your city ready for the night, when zombies may attack. To advance the day press the "NEXT DAY" button Use your resources wisely to get upgrades, build buildings, and eventually win. </p>

        <h3>Buildings</h3>
        <p>Buildings have many different uses. Shelters and houses allow more people to live in your city. Silos increase the maximum food storage, which is necessary for winter when no crops can grow. Fortifications increase your cities defense. The research center allows you to start researching but takes 1 day to build. In order to build you need to reclaim land from the zombies. To do this you can send soldiers out, soldier have a chance of dying though. It takes one day for soldiers to claim land, and only one group can be sent out at a  time.  The amount of land gained is equal to the amount of surviving soldiers.   </p>

        <h3>Inventory</h3>
        <p>The inventory is a list of the current supplies you have on hand. Gold is used to buy items from merchants. Food feeds your city, each citizen eats 1 food a day and each farmer producer 4 food a day with a level 1 farm. Soldiers use ammo to defend your city. If you run out of ammo, soldiers can still defend, they're just not as effective. Metal, wood, and wire are used for upgrades. Each day lumberjacks collect wood while miners collect ore (used to smelt metal in the forge), coal, and gold. Wire is only obtainable in the store</p>

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>Research can only begin 1 day after the first research center is built. Radio level affects the chance of people arriving in your town. Wall level affects your cities defense. Farm-level effects amount of food grown per farmer.</p>

        <h3>Store</h3>
        <p>The store is where you can trade gold for supplies. The store is run by traveling merchants, who abide by no schedule. The type of materials also changes from store to store. </p>

        <h3>Forge</h3>
        <p>The forge is where you can smelt metal from ore, and bullets from metal. </p>
